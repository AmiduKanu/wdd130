          <h2>MULTI DAY ADVENTURES</h2>
          <p> <img  class="ima_ge left " src="images/river.jpg" alt="river" />
            As a leader in rafting and adventure travel since 1969, you could say we know a thing or two about providing an unforgettable vacation.Every multi-day adventure with OARS combines amazing rivers, friendly guides, incredible scenery, quality gear, comfortable camping and unexpectedly delicious food, but the OARS multi-day experience is the unique and captivating sum of all those parts. It’s so much more than a river trip.
            An OARS multi-day adventure is about losing track of what time it is, or even what day of the week it is. It’s about leaving emails and text messages and Facebook at home.

          <p>
            OARS was founded in 1969 by river pioneer George Wendt. By 1974 the company found its permanent home in Angels Camp, California, where George and his wife Pam turned a fledgling rafting company into what is now one of the most respected outfitting companies in the world. George was president of OARS for 47 years until his passing in July of 2016. He was a visionary entrepreneur and one of the adventure travel industry’s trailblazers. But more importantly, he left a legacy of river conservation and stewardship based on the inspiring idea that spreading the love of wild rivers is the surest path to their protection, now and for the enjoyment of future generations.

            <h2 class="third">Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>One of the things that impressed me the most was the stewardship of the canyon that all of the guides were a part of. They made sure all of us understood the fragile nature of the canyon and how to best take care of it for those who followed us. The fact that they really love the ‘place where they work’ impressed me. Keep up the good work and the awesome stewardship of the canyon</p>
